    /**
     * Steps to clean up the package structure:
     * 
     * 1. Delete any files in the com.learninghub.app package
     *    - These files should have already been recreated in the com.knowit.app package
     * 
     * 2. Search for import statements referencing com.learninghub.app
     *    - Find all import statements like: import com.learninghub.app.*
     *    - Replace them with: import com.knowit.app.*
     * 
     * 3. Make sure all entity classes have the proper Lombok annotations
     *    - @Data
     *    - @NoArgsConstructor
     *    - @AllArgsConstructor
     *    - @Builder (where appropriate)
     * 
     * 4. If Lombok still isn't working, manually add getters and setters to model classes
     * 
     * 5. Run a project clean and build
     *    - In Eclipse: Project > Clean...
     *    - In Maven: mvn clean install
